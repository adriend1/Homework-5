This is the code for Homework 5.  For this assignment, we were tasked with making a work day scheduler.  

In my code, I focused on creating a clean and easy to use application.  In order to do this, I created a lot of rows in the HTML so that I could easily input the tasks needed for the day inside them.

In order to complete the project, I utilized a lot of click functions to indicate to the code what to do.
